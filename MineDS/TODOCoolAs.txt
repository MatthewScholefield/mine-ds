Fix World Saving
Remove set tools on spawn
---RELEASE---

Adjust the internal crafting system so multiple items can be used to create one item (ex. 1 jungle/birch/regular all can create 4 planks within the same crafting recipe)

---Fix Small Bugs in Crafting Menu---
-Lock controls while in crafting menu
-Stop the start key from bringing up the main menu when in the crafting menu (it makes graphical glitches)

---Optimize crafting menu UI---
-only show/show first the crafting recipes that the player has items for
-subcategorize items (perhaps with buttons for each categorie)
