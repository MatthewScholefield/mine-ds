[s]Glass doesn't let light through[/s]
[s]Glass doesn't show the bg layer[/s]
[s]Can break both bg layers at once.[/s]
[s]Log in foreground should be solid[/s]
[s]When a player leaves it creates a ghost.[/s]
[s]With many mobs world transfers very slow
	Ideas:
	Make Wifi Updates for mobs slower during a world download.
		(How do we know if somebody quits during a download?)
	Kill all non human mobs when a block request is recieved.
	Don't take notice of mob updates on the client when downloading the world[/s]
	We had other issues with many mobs, you can only spawn five at the moment which fixes the issue. (Anyway five mobs are extremely hard to kill without dying)
